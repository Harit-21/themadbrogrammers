## 3. **Detailed Step-by-Step Development Plan**

---

### Phase 1: **Project Setup & Core Infrastructure**

* Setup Flutter environment and Android Studio
* Initialize Flutter project
* Setup Supabase project (database + auth)
* Setup Cloudinary account and get API keys
* Integrate Supabase SDK and Cloudinary upload APIs in Flutter
* Implement user authentication with Supabase (optional but recommended)

---

### Phase 2: **Basic Upload & Listing**

* Build UI for picking audio files (`file_picker`)
* Upload audio files to Cloudinary using their REST API
* Save song metadata (title, URL, artist placeholder) to Supabase Postgres table
* Create a simple listing page fetching all songs from Supabase and showing titles
* Display loading states and errors

---

### Phase 3: **Playback Functionality**

* Integrate `just_audio` to play songs by URL from Cloudinary
* Implement playback controls (play, pause, seek)
* Add audio session handling for background playback & interruptions
* Show current playing song info on a dedicated screen

---

### Phase 4: **Cover Art and Metadata**

* Extend upload flow to optionally upload cover art images to Cloudinary
* Save cover art URLs to Supabase alongside song metadata
* Display cover art in song listings and now playing screen
* Add UI for editing song metadata (title, artist, album)

---

### Phase 5: **UI/UX Enhancements**

* Implement Retro / Modern theme toggle
* Improve app navigation (e.g., bottom nav bar)
* Add pull-to-refresh for song lists
* Add smooth animations and polished UI details

---

### Phase 6: **Additional Features (Optional)**

* Playlists and Favorites support with extra tables in Supabase
* User profiles with saved preferences
* Offline caching (advanced)
* Social sharing options
* Analytics & usage stats

---

## 4. **Architecture & Data Flow**

```plaintext
User Device (Flutter App)
      |
      | -- Uploads audio file (MP3) & cover image --> Cloudinary Storage (CDN)
      | -- Sends metadata (title, artist, URLs) -------> Supabase Postgres DB
      |
      | <-- Fetch song list with metadata ---------------- Supabase DB
      | <-- Fetch audio URL ------------------------------- Cloudinary CDN
      | <-- Playback controlled by just_audio with URL
```

---

## 5. **Security & Cost Considerations**

* Use **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)** policies to secure metadata access
* Use **Cloudinary unsigned uploads** or signed uploads depending on your security preference
* Monitor storage & bandwidth usage on Cloudinary (free tier generous)
* Limit upload sizes & file types client-side for performance and security

---

## 6. **Tools & Accounts You Need**

* Flutter SDK & Android Studio (already done)
* Supabase project (free tier is enough)
* Cloudinary account (free tier is enough)
* Optional: Firebase for notifications or analytics (later)

## 6. **Architecture & Data Flow**

```plaintext
User Device (Flutter App)
      |
      | -- Sign in via Supabase Auth (identifies user)
      | -- Upload audio + cover â†’ Cloudinary (media storage)
      | -- Send metadata + uploader ID â†’ Supabase DB (songs table)

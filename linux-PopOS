---

I’ll teach you interactively: explain → show → practice → troubleshoot.
No third-party stuff needed — unless *you* want to use it.

So — where do *you* want to start?




Perfect. You're about to **master Pop!\_OS and Linux** from the ground up — no fluff, just the real stuff that makes you powerful on the command line and beyond.

---

# 🧱 Phase 1: Core Linux Foundations

### 🔥 Part 1: Terminal Basics — Let’s Begin

---

## 🖥️ What Is the Terminal?

The **terminal** (also called a shell or CLI) lets you interact with your system by typing commands. It’s **faster, more powerful**, and often **more scriptable** than using a GUI.

You're likely using **Bash** or **Zsh** on Pop!\_OS.

To open the terminal in Pop!\_OS:

* Press **`Super (Windows key) + T`**, or
* Search for **“Terminal”** in your app launcher.

---

## 🔧 Basic Commands You’ll Use Every Day

Let’s go through these one-by-one. Type them, don’t just read them.

### 📁 1. `pwd` – Show your current directory

```bash
pwd
```

You'll see something like:

```
/home/themadbrogrammers
```

This tells you *where* you are in the file system.

---

### 📂 2. `ls` – List files in a directory

```bash
ls
```

To list with details:

```bash
ls -l
```

To see hidden files:

```bash
ls -la
```

---

### 🚶‍♂️ 3. `cd` – Change directory

```bash
cd /home
```

Back to your home:

```bash
cd ~
```

Up one level:

```bash
cd ..
```

---

### 📄 4. `touch` – Create a file

```bash
touch hello.txt
```

Now list with `ls` and see the new file!

---

### 📁 5. `mkdir` – Create a directory (folder)

```bash
mkdir myfolder
```

---

### 🧹 6. `rm` – Delete files or folders

```bash
rm hello.txt         # delete a file
rm -r myfolder       # delete a folder
```

**⚠️ Be careful with `rm -r` — it deletes permanently.**

---

### 📤 7. `mv` – Move or rename files

```bash
mv hello.txt myfolder/        # Move file into folder
mv hello.txt hello2.txt       # Rename file
```

---

### 📥 8. `cp` – Copy files or folders

```bash
cp file.txt file2.txt           # Copy file
cp -r folder1/ folder2/         # Copy folders recursively
```

---

### 🧠 9. `man` – Manual pages (Help!)

```bash
man ls
```

Press `q` to quit.
This is your **built-in documentation** — almost every command has a man page.

---

### 💡 Quick Practice Task:

Try doing this:

1. Open your terminal
2. Run:

   ```bash
   mkdir test_folder
   cd test_folder
   touch test1.txt test2.txt
   ls -l
   mv test1.txt renamed.txt
   cp renamed.txt copy.txt
   rm test2.txt
   cd ..
   rm -r test_folder
   ```

You’ll have created, renamed, copied, deleted files and folders. Boom. 🚀

---

## 🔍 Up Next:

We’ll cover:

* File system layout (what is `/`, `/home`, `/etc`, etc.)
* Navigating like a ninja
* Making sense of file permissions

---

Would you like:

* A quick quiz on what we just learned?
* Or go straight to the next lesson on **Linux File System Structure**?

Let me know 👇





Awesome. Let’s dive into one of the most important pieces of Linux mastery:

# 🧭 Part 2: The Linux File System Structure

Unlike Windows (which uses drives like `C:\`, `D:\`), Linux has **one single root filesystem**, starting at `/` (called “root”), and everything branches out from there — **no separate drive letters**.

---

## 🌳 Linux Directory Tree Overview

Here’s a map to keep in mind:

```
/
├── bin/
├── boot/
├── dev/
├── etc/
├── home/
│   └── themadbrogrammers/
├── lib/
├── media/
├── mnt/
├── opt/
├── proc/
├── root/
├── run/
├── sbin/
├── srv/
├── sys/
├── tmp/
├── usr/
└── var/
```

Let’s break this down:

---

## 🔍 The Most Important Directories You’ll Use

| Directory | Description                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`       | The **root** directory — the top of the hierarchy.               |
| `/home/`  | Where **your personal files** live (like `C:\Users\you`).        |
| `/root/`  | The home directory for the **root user** (admin).                |
| `/etc/`   | System-wide **config files**.                                    |
| `/bin/`   | Essential **binary (executable) programs** like `ls`, `cp`.      |
| `/sbin/`  | System binaries — admin tools like `shutdown`, `reboot`.         |
| `/usr/`   | User programs, libraries, docs. Contains `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`. |
| `/var/`   | Variable data: **logs**, mail, print spool.                      |
| `/tmp/`   | Temporary files — deleted on reboot.                             |
| `/dev/`   | Device files (hard drives, USB, etc.).                           |
| `/proc/`  | Virtual filesystem — kernel and process info.                    |
| `/media/` | Auto-mounted external devices (USB, SD cards).                   |
| `/mnt/`   | Temporary mount points (manual).                                 |
| `/opt/`   | Optional software (like Steam, Zoom, etc.).                      |

---

### 🧠 What You Should Remember:

* You live in `/home/yourname/`
* Configs are in `/etc/`
* System binaries are in `/bin/`, `/usr/bin/`, or `/sbin/`
* Logs are in `/var/log/`
* Devices are represented as files in `/dev/` (e.g. `/dev/sda1`)
* The kernel and system internals live in `/proc/` and `/sys/`

---

### 📦 Real Examples

```bash
cd /
ls
```

You’ll see the root folders listed above.

To see your logs:

```bash
cd /var/log
ls
cat syslog | less
```

To view kernel info:

```bash
cat /proc/cpuinfo
cat /proc/meminfo
```

To look at config files:

```bash
cd /etc
ls
cat hostname
```

To view what's in your user folder:

```bash
cd ~
ls -a
```

(`-a` shows hidden files like `.bashrc` or `.config`)

---

## ✅ What You Can Do With This Knowledge

* Understand **where everything is** on your system
* Know where to go to **edit configs**, check logs, install software manually
* Diagnose hardware, disks, USBs (via `/dev`, `/media`, `/mnt`)
* Navigate confidently with `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `less`, `find`

---

## 💡 Practice Tasks:

Try these now:

1. Find out your hostname:

   ```bash
   cat /etc/hostname
   ```

2. Explore your logs:

   ```bash
   cd /var/log
   ls -lh
   ```

3. Check your system CPU info:

   ```bash
   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name" | head -1
   ```

4. List all hidden files in your home:

   ```bash
   ls -la ~
   ```

## 🔜 Coming Next:

### 👉 Part 3: User & Permission Management

* How users, groups, and permissions work
* Using `chmod`, `chown`, `usermod`, and `sudo` properly
* How Linux controls who can do what

Let me know when you're ready to continue.
Or say `quiz me` if you want to test yourself first.



Awesome — let’s go deeper. You're doing great.

---

# 🧑‍💻 Part 3: **Users, Groups & Permissions in Linux**

This is one of the **most important concepts in Linux** — it controls **who can do what** on your system.

---

## 👥 1. Users & Groups

Every Linux system has:

* **Users**: Your login account (`themadbrogrammers`, `root`, etc.)
* **Groups**: Collections of users with shared permissions

### 🧪 Try this:

```bash
whoami        # Shows your current username
id            # Shows your UID, GID, and group memberships
```

---

## 🔑 2. The Root User (Superuser)

* `root` has **unlimited control** over the system.
* Use `sudo` to run commands as root.

```bash
sudo apt update      # Run with root privileges
```

You can also switch to root (not recommended for regular use):

```bash
sudo -i      # Become root shell
exit         # Exit root shell
```

---

## 🧾 3. User Management Commands

| Command                 | Action                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `adduser john`          | Adds a new user                     |
| `passwd john`           | Sets or changes password            |
| `usermod -aG sudo john` | Adds user to a group (e.g., `sudo`) |
| `deluser john`          | Deletes a user                      |
| `groups john`           | Shows user's groups                 |

---

## 🔐 4. File Ownership & Permissions

Each file has:

* An **owner**
* A **group**
* A set of **permissions**

### 📄 Check with `ls -l`

```bash
ls -l
```

Example output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 themadbrogrammers themadbrogrammers 1234 Jun 13 12:00 notes.txt
```

Breakdown:

* `-rw-r--r--` = permissions
* First part: owner permissions (`rw-`)
* Second part: group permissions (`r--`)
* Third part: others (`r--`)

---

## 🛠 5. Changing Permissions: `chmod`

### Symbols:

* `r` = read
* `w` = write
* `x` = execute

```bash
chmod u+x script.sh      # Add execute to user
chmod g-w file.txt       # Remove write from group
chmod 755 file.sh        # rwxr-xr-x (user full, others can read/execute)
```

---

## 👤 6. Changing Owner or Group: `chown`

```bash
chown root file.txt              # Change owner to root
chown john:john file.txt         # Change owner and group
```

---

### 🧪 Practice Tasks:

Try creating a file and experimenting:

```bash
touch testfile
ls -l testfile
chmod 600 testfile
ls -l testfile
```

What did `600` do?

* `6` = `rw-` for user
* `0` = no permissions for group
* `0` = no permissions for others

Now try:

```bash
chmod 777 testfile
ls -l testfile
```

Now everyone has read/write/execute access — not secure, but good to understand.

---

## 🧠 Summary:

* You are a user with a username and belong to groups.
* Files have **permissions** for user, group, and others.
* `chmod` controls access, `chown` controls ownership.
* Use `sudo` for admin-level actions.

---

## 🧗 Coming Up Next:

### 👉 Part 4: **Installing & Managing Software**

* `apt`, `dpkg`, `flatpak`
* Pop!\_Shop vs Terminal
* How to search, install, update, and remove apps

Let me know when you're ready to continue. Or ask anything about users/permissions!


Perfect — let’s move forward.

---

# 📦 Part 4: **Installing & Managing Software in Pop!\_OS/Linux**

This is one of the **most practical skills** you'll use daily — how to install, update, and remove software using package managers. In Pop!\_OS (Ubuntu-based), you have multiple options, and knowing when to use which is key.

---

## 🛠️ 1. Package Managers: What Are They?

In Linux, most software is installed via **package managers** — they download and install software **and dependencies** for you.

### Main types used in Pop!\_OS:

| Package Manager | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apt`           | **Main CLI manager** for `.deb` packages (Ubuntu/Debian).      |
| `dpkg`          | Lower-level `.deb` installer.                                  |
| `flatpak`       | Universal package format, runs apps in sandboxed environments. |
| **Pop!\_Shop**  | GUI store powered by Flatpak and APT combined.                 |

---

## ⚙️ 2. Using `apt` (Advanced Packaging Tool)

### 🧼 Always update first:

```bash
sudo apt update       # Fetch latest package info
sudo apt upgrade      # Upgrade installed software
```

### 📥 To install software:

```bash
sudo apt install package-name
```

Example:

```bash
sudo apt install neofetch
```

### 🗑️ To remove software:

```bash
sudo apt remove package-name       # Removes the program
sudo apt purge package-name        # Removes + config files
```

### 🧹 Clean up:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove                # Remove unused packages
sudo apt clean                     # Clear package cache
```

---

## 📦 3. Using `dpkg` (for `.deb` files manually)

If you download a `.deb` file directly (like Chrome), install it with:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
sudo apt install -f     # Fix dependencies if needed
```

---

## 🟢 4. Using `flatpak` (for sandboxed universal apps)

### Install Flatpak if not already:

```bash
sudo apt install flatpak
```

Add the main app repo:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

### Install an app:

```bash
flatpak install flathub com.spotify.Client
```

### Run the app:

```bash
flatpak run com.spotify.Client
```

### Remove:

```bash
flatpak uninstall com.spotify.Client
```

---

## 🛍️ 5. Using **Pop!\_Shop**

* Graphical interface for managing both `apt` and `flatpak` packages.
* Very beginner-friendly.
* Not ideal for automation, but great for quick app searches.

---

## 🔍 6. Searching for Packages

### With APT:

```bash
apt search keyword
apt show package-name
```

### With Flatpak:

```bash
flatpak search keyword
```

---

## 🧪 Practice Tasks:

1. Install `neofetch`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install neofetch
   neofetch
   ```

2. Install `htop` (a system monitor):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install htop
   htop
   ```

3. Search for a program:

   ```bash
   apt search vlc
   ```

4. Remove a package:

   ```bash
   sudo apt remove htop
   ```

---

## 🔐 Bonus Tip: Keep Your System Healthy

Update everything with:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove --purge
```

---

## 🧠 Summary:

| Task                 | Command                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Install APT package  | `sudo apt install name`      |
| Remove package       | `sudo apt remove name`       |
| Update package list  | `sudo apt update`            |
| Upgrade all packages | `sudo apt upgrade`           |
| Install from Flatpak | `flatpak install flathub id` |
| Run Flatpak app      | `flatpak run id`             |

---

## 🔜 Next Up:

### 👉 Part 5: **Process & System Monitoring**

* How to check what's running
* Kill/stop frozen programs
* Manage system resources with `top`, `htop`, and `ps`

Let me know when you’re ready to move on — or want a quiz first.



Got it. We’ll continue seamlessly and in-depth — no pauses, no repeats unless you ask. Let’s go.

---

# 📊 Part 5: **Process & System Monitoring in Linux**

Your system is constantly running background tasks — apps, services, daemons, etc. As a power user, you need to monitor, control, and kill these processes when needed.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Understanding Processes

A **process** is any running program or command. Each has a **PID** (Process ID), a user, and system resources it uses (CPU, memory, etc.).

You interact with processes using tools like `ps`, `top`, `htop`, and `kill`.

---

## 📌 2. `ps` – View Active Processes (Snapshot)

```bash
ps aux
```

* `a`: Show processes from all users
* `u`: Show user-oriented output
* `x`: Include background processes (without terminal)

Example output:

```
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.1    /sbin/init
user      2345  0.2  2.1    /usr/bin/firefox
```

You’ll see PID, CPU/memory usage, and the command.

---

## 📈 3. `top` – Real-time System Monitor

```bash
top
```

Live view of running processes. It updates every few seconds.

**Keyboard shortcuts in `top`:**

* `q` → Quit
* `k` → Kill a process by PID
* `P` → Sort by CPU
* `M` → Sort by memory

---

## 🖥️ 4. `htop` – Enhanced `top` (color, better UI)

Install it:

```bash
sudo apt install htop
```

Run:

```bash
htop
```

It shows a better overview:

* CPU, memory, swap usage
* Process tree
* You can use **arrow keys**, **F-keys**, and **mouse**!

---

## 🛑 5. Killing Processes

When something freezes or eats your CPU, kill it:

### Find the process:

```bash
ps aux | grep firefox
```

### Kill by PID:

```bash
kill 2345
```

### Force kill (like Task Manager "End Task"):

```bash
kill -9 2345
```

Or with `htop`: scroll to the process, press `F9`, then `SIGKILL`.

---

## 🔁 6. Background & Foreground Jobs

### Run a process in the background:

```bash
gedit &
```

The `&` puts it in the background.

### List background jobs:

```bash
jobs
```

### Bring it back to foreground:

```bash
fg %1
```

Or stop it:

```bash
kill %1
```

---

## 🧠 Summary Table:

| Command       | Purpose                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ps aux`      | Show all running processes          |
| `top`         | Live system monitor                 |
| `htop`        | Better system monitor (install it!) |
| `kill PID`    | Terminate a process                 |
| `kill -9 PID` | Force kill                          |
| `jobs`        | Show background jobs                |
| `fg`, `bg`    | Move job to foreground/background   |

---

# 🌐 Part 6: Networking Basics in Linux

Knowing how to manage your system’s network is key for debugging, connecting to services, or even hacking.

---

## 🌍 1. Check IP Address and Interfaces

```bash
ip a
```

This shows your active network interfaces and their IPs.

---

## 📶 2. Test Connectivity

```bash
ping google.com
```

Stops with `Ctrl + C`. Good for checking if the internet is working.

---

## 🔎 3. View Routing Table

```bash
ip route
```

Shows where your traffic goes. Default gateway is usually your router.

---

## 🧑‍💻 4. DNS & Hostname Info

```bash
hostname          # Show system hostname
cat /etc/resolv.conf   # Show DNS servers being used
```

---

## 🧰 5. Network Tools (install if needed)

```bash
sudo apt install net-tools
```

Now you can use:

```bash
ifconfig        # Old but popular alternative to `ip a`
netstat -tulpn  # See open ports and listening services
```

---

## 🔐 6. Open Ports and Services

```bash
sudo ss -tuln
```

* `t` = TCP
* `u` = UDP
* `l` = Listening
* `n` = Show numbers (IP/port)

---

## 🛠 7. Restart Network Services (if needed)

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

---

## 🧠 Networking Summary:

| Command          | Description                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `ip a`           | View interfaces and IPs      |
| `ping host`      | Check internet connectivity  |
| `ip route`       | Show routing table           |
| `netstat -tulpn` | View open ports and services |
| `hostname`       | View system name             |
| `ss -tuln`       | See network socket activity  |

---

# 🧱 Part 7: Disk & Filesystem Management

You’ll need to manage storage: check disk space, mount drives, view partitions, etc.

---

## 🧮 1. View Disk Space

```bash
df -h
```

* `-h` = human-readable
  Shows disk usage for all mounted partitions.

---

## 📦 2. See Disk & Partition Info

```bash
lsblk
```

Shows all block devices (hard drives, partitions, USB drives).

---

## 💿 3. Mount/Unmount Drives

Create mount point:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/usb
```

Mount:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
```

Unmount:

```bash
sudo umount /mnt/usb
```

---

## 🔐 4. View Disk Usage Per Folder

```bash
du -sh *
```

* `-s`: summary
* `-h`: human-readable

Good to find out what's using space in `/home`, `/var`, etc.

---

## 📁 5. Format a USB (⚠️ Destroys data!)

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

Or for FAT32:

```bash
sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
```

---

## 🧠 Disk Management Summary:

| Command          | Purpose                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| `df -h`          | Check free space          |
| `lsblk`          | Show disks and partitions |
| `mount / umount` | Attach/detach drives      |
| `du -sh *`       | Check folder sizes        |
| `mkfs.ext4`      | Format a drive            |

# 🔥 Up Next: Bash Scripting & Automation

(You’ll start programming the system — like creating your own commands, backups, and automation tools.)

Let's keep going.



Perfect — let’s power through into scripting now. This is where the **real control** begins.

---

# 🧠 Part 8: **Bash Scripting & Automation**

In Linux, you can create **scripts** (small programs written in Bash) to automate tasks like:

* Installing packages
* Backing up files
* Monitoring your system
* Setting up entire dev environments

---

## 🧾 1. What is a Bash Script?

A Bash script is just a **text file** containing a sequence of shell commands.

It always starts with a **shebang**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

This tells the system: “Run this with the Bash interpreter.”

---

## ✍️ 2. Create Your First Script

### Step-by-step:

```bash
nano hello.sh
```

Paste this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, $USER! Today is $(date)"
```

Save and exit with:

* `Ctrl + O` to write
* `Enter`
* `Ctrl + X` to exit

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
```

Run it:

```bash
./hello.sh
```

💥 You just wrote and ran your first script.

---

## 🧩 3. Variables in Bash

```bash
name="TheMadBrogrammers"
echo "Welcome, $name"
```

Variables can store strings, numbers, commands.

---

## 🔁 4. Conditionals: `if`, `else`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$USER" = "root" ]; then
  echo "You are root"
else
  echo "You are $USER"
fi
```

---

## 🔄 5. Loops

### For Loop:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  echo "Number $i"
done
```

### While Loop:

```bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Loop $counter"
  ((counter++))
done
```

---

## 🛠 6. Functions

```bash
greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet "world"
```

---

## 📦 7. Real Automation Examples

### 📂 Backup Script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
src="$HOME/Documents"
dest="$HOME/backup_$(date +%F)"
mkdir -p "$dest"
cp -r "$src" "$dest"
echo "Backup done to $dest"
```

Run it, and your entire Documents folder is backed up into a date-stamped folder.

---

## 🔌 8. Cron Jobs: Automate Script Execution

### Edit cron jobs:

```bash
crontab -e
```

### Example:

Run script every day at 2 AM:

```
0 2 * * * /home/you/backup.sh
```

---

## 🔒 9. Error Handling

```bash
if cp file1 file2; then
  echo "Copy successful"
else
  echo "Copy failed"
fi
```

Or exit if something fails:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # stop on first error
```

---

## 🧠 Bash Scripting Summary:

| Concept    | Example                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Shebang    | `#!/bin/bash`                       |
| Variable   | `name="John"`                       |
| Run script | `./script.sh`                       |
| If         | `if [ "$USER" = "root" ]; then ...` |
| Loop       | `for i in ...; do ... done`         |
| Function   | `myfunc() { echo "hi"; }`           |
| Automation | `crontab -e`                        |

# 🧰 Part 10: Linux Power Tools & Shortcuts

You're nearly unstoppable. Let’s master what makes pros fast.

---

## 🧙 1. Aliases (Your Own Commands)

Edit your shell config:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add lines like:

```bash
alias gs='git status'
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'
alias cls='clear'
```

Apply changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## 🔎 2. `grep`, `find`, `xargs` – CLI Search Weapons

### Search inside files:

```bash
grep "main" *.c
```

### Find files:

```bash
find . -name "*.sh"
```

### Combine with `xargs`:

```bash
find . -name "*.log" | xargs rm
```

---

## 🔄 3. History & Shortcuts

* `!!` = run last command again
* `!sudo` = run last command with sudo
* `Ctrl + R` = search history
* `Tab` = autocomplete
* `Ctrl + C` = kill command
* `Ctrl + D` = logout/exit

---

## 🔌 4. Background Jobs

* `sleep 10 &` → run in background
* `jobs` → list
* `fg`, `bg` → bring to foreground/background
* `kill %1` → kill job

---

## 🧠 Summary: Power Workflow

# 🔥 FINAL STAGE: Linux Customization & Hacking

Coming up next:

* Dotfiles, theming, fonts
* Window managers (i3, bspwm, awesomeWM)
* Boot config (GRUB, systemd)
* Creating your own live ISO / arch install scripts
* Dual-boot, encrypted partitions
* Writing your own Linux CLI tool from scratch

Let’s keep going.



You got it. Final stretch — let’s turn you into a full-blown Linux wizard 🧙‍♂️. We’re moving into **advanced customization, low-level control, and Linux hacking**.

---

# 🎨 Part 11: Linux Customization & Dotfiles

## 🎯 Goal:

Make your Linux setup uniquely yours — **fast**, beautiful, and portable.

---

## 🧾 1. Dotfiles: Your System's DNA

**Dotfiles** are hidden config files (like `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, `.gitconfig`) that define:

* Aliases
* Themes
* Prompt styles
* Git behavior
* Editor configs
* Window manager layouts

### 🔍 List all dotfiles:

```bash
ls -la ~ | grep "^\."
```

### 📁 Create a dotfiles repo:

```bash
mkdir ~/dotfiles
cp ~/.bashrc ~/dotfiles/
cd ~/dotfiles
git init
git add .
git commit -m "My bash config"
```

### 💡 Pro Tip:

Use symlinks so your system always uses the latest from your repo:

```bash
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

You can now carry your config across machines.

---

## 🎨 2. Theming Your System

### 🔤 Fonts:

Install beautiful dev fonts like:

```bash
sudo apt install fonts-firacode
```

Use it in your terminal + code editor.

### 🎨 Terminal Themes:

Install **oh-my-bash** or **oh-my-zsh** for better prompts:

```bash
sudo apt install zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

---

### 🔥 Prompt Themes:

Use `powerlevel10k` for ZSH:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/.powerlevel10k
echo 'source ~/.powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc
```

---

## 🖼 3. Custom Terminal: Tilix / Alacritty

```bash
sudo apt install tilix
```

Or for ultra-speed:

```bash
sudo apt install alacritty
```

---

## 🪟 4. Window Managers (WM): i3, bspwm, awesomeWM

These replace GNOME with **keyboard-driven power setups**.

### 🧱 i3wm Example:

```bash
sudo apt install i3
```

Logout and choose i3 session on login.

* `Mod+Enter` → Terminal
* `Mod+d` → Launcher
* `Mod+Shift+q` → Kill window

Customize config at `~/.config/i3/config`

---

## 🧠 5. Save Everything into Dotfiles

Example dotfiles repo:

```
~/dotfiles
├── .bashrc
├── .zshrc
├── .vimrc
├── .config/
│   ├── i3/
│   └── alacritty/
└── install.sh
```

Then use `install.sh` to setup everything on new systems.

---

# ⚙️ Part 12: Boot Process & Systemd

Understanding the Linux **boot process** gives you control from power-on to login.

---

## 🧬 1. Boot Steps Overview

1. **BIOS/UEFI** — Hardware setup
2. **GRUB** — Bootloader
3. **Kernel** — Linux core starts
4. **init/systemd** — Starts services
5. **Login Manager** — You login
6. **Desktop or WM starts**

---

## ⚙️ 2. Manage Boot with GRUB

Edit default kernel, resolution, timeout:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Update GRUB:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

---

## 🔥 3. systemd: Service Manager

See running services:

```bash
systemctl
```

Check one:

```bash
systemctl status bluetooth.service
```

Start/stop/enable/disable:

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

---

# 🔐 Part 13: Disk Encryption & Dual Boot

## 🔐 Encrypt Drive During Install

Pop!\_OS lets you do **full disk encryption**. If you missed it:

* Use `LUKS` to encrypt a partition
* Or reinstall with encryption option on

---

## 🪟 Dual Boot with Windows

1. Install Windows first
2. Then install Pop!\_OS
3. Use `GRUB` to manage both

Fix bootloader with:

```bash
sudo grub-install
sudo update-grub
```

---

# 🛠 Part 14: Build Your Own CLI Tool

Let’s make a command called `sayhi`.

### Step 1: Create the script

```bash
nano ~/bin/sayhi
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hey $USER! Keep dominating Linux!"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/bin/sayhi
```

Add to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can run:

```bash
sayhi
```

🎉 You just made your own Linux command!

---

# ⚡ Part 15: Terminal Power Stack (tmux, fzf, ripgrep, bat, zoxide)

### Why this matters:

With the right tools, you’ll move **10× faster** than a mouse-based user.

---

## 🧱 1. `tmux`: Terminal Multiplexer

Think of it as **multiple terminals in one window**, with session persistence.

### 📦 Install:

```bash
sudo apt install tmux
```

### 🧪 Try:

```bash
tmux
```

Now you’re inside a tmux session.

* `Ctrl + b` then `c` → new terminal tab
* `Ctrl + b` then `n` → next pane
* `Ctrl + b` then `%` → vertical split
* `Ctrl + b` then `"` → horizontal split
* `Ctrl + b` then `d` → detach session
* `tmux attach` → reattach

You can even reboot, log back in, and **restore** your exact workflow.

---

## 🔍 2. `fzf`: Fuzzy Finder

Lets you **instantly find anything** in any list (history, files, processes, etc).

### 📦 Install:

```bash
sudo apt install fzf
```

Try it with:

```bash
history | fzf
```

or:

```bash
vim $(fzf)
```

---

## 🧪 3. `ripgrep` (aka `rg`): Supercharged `grep`

```bash
sudo apt install ripgrep
```

Usage:

```bash
rg "main" .
```

Faster, smarter file content searching than grep or find.

---

## 🖤 4. `bat`: Better `cat`

```bash
sudo apt install bat
```

Use like:

```bash
bat ~/.bashrc
```

It adds syntax highlighting, line numbers, etc.

---

## 📁 5. `zoxide`: Smart `cd`

```bash
sudo apt install zoxide
```

Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(zoxide init bash)"
```

Now use:

```bash
z ~/D → jumps to ~/Documents if you’ve been there before
```

It remembers where you’ve been and auto-jumps.

---

## 🧠 Power Stack Summary:

| Tool     | Replaces | Purpose                           |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `tmux`   | tabs     | Split terminals, persist sessions |
| `fzf`    | Ctrl+R   | Fuzzy history/search              |
| `rg`     | grep     | Fast, recursive text search       |
| `bat`    | cat      | Pretty file viewer                |
| `zoxide` | cd       | Smart directory jumping           |

---

# 🧪 Part 16: Advanced Scripting Projects (Real Automation)

### ✅ 1. Auto System Update Script

Create:

```bash
nano ~/bin/sysupdate
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Updating system..."

flatpak update -y
echo "Done!"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/bin/sysupdate
```

Now just run:

```bash
sysupdate
```

---

### ✅ 2. Daily Backup Script

```bash
nano ~/bin/backup_home
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
dest="$HOME/backups/home_$(date +%F_%H-%M)"
mkdir -p "$dest"
rsync -a --progress $HOME/Documents "$dest"
echo "Backup complete to $dest"
```

Schedule it:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add:

```
0 3 * * * /home/yourname/bin/backup_home
```

Runs every day at 3am.

## 🔧 PROJECT 1: **Your Own Linux CLI Tool — “TaskBox”**

### 📌 Goal:

A terminal-based task manager with save/load functionality.

### 🛠 Tech: Bash, JSON, file I/O

### ✅ Features:

* `taskbox add "Finish blog post"`
* `taskbox list`
* `taskbox done 2`
* Stores tasks in `~/.taskbox/tasks.json`

### 🧱 Build Steps:

**1. Folder structure:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.taskbox
touch ~/.taskbox/tasks.json
echo "[]" > ~/.taskbox/tasks.json
```

**2. Script: `~/bin/taskbox`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
file="$HOME/.taskbox/tasks.json"

add_task() {
  task="$1"
  jq ". + [{\"task\":\"$task\",\"done\":false}]" "$file" > tmp.$$.json && mv tmp.$$.json "$file"
  echo "Task added: $task"
}

list_tasks() {
  jq -c '.[]' "$file" | nl
}

mark_done() {
  id=$1
  jq ".[$((id-1))].done = true" "$file" > tmp.$$.json && mv tmp.$$.json "$file"
  echo "Task $id marked done."
}

case $1 in
  add) shift; add_task "$*" ;;
  list) list_tasks ;;
  done) mark_done "$2" ;;
  *) echo "Usage: taskbox add|list|done <id>" ;;
esac
```

**3. Install dependencies:**

```bash
sudo apt install jq
chmod +x ~/bin/taskbox
```

**✅ Now you can use:**

```bash
taskbox add "Hack the planet"
taskbox list
taskbox done 1
```

🔥 You just made your first **persistent Linux command-line app.**

## 🔐 Example CTF Workflow (Web Vuln)

1. Scan target:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.10
```

2. Enumerate hidden dirs:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.10 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

3. Exploit login form:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt 10.10.10.10 http-post-form "/login.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:F=incorrect"
```

4. Escalate privileges:

```bash
sudo -l
```

Check for misconfig, SUID binaries, etc.

## 🔥 Want to Hack Real Targets?

Try:

* `TryHackMe: Linux PrivEsc`
* `HackTheBox: Bashed`, `OpenAdmin`, `Beep`
* `OverTheWire: Bandit` (Linux wargames)

## 👾 BONUS: Set Up a Local CTF Lab

Use Docker or VirtualBox to run vulnerable machines:

* `VulnHub.com` → download CTF VMs
* `Metasploitable` → preloaded vulnerable OS
* `DVWA` (Damn Vulnerable Web App)

Example:

```bash
docker pull vulnerables/web-dvwa
docker run -d -p 8081:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa
```

Access at: `http://localhost:8081`
